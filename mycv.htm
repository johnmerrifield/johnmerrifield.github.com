 <h1>Curriculum Vitae</h1>
<p>I am currently fulfilling a base site engineering role in London and South East for UK Broadband Ltd.  The network
was originally built for proprietary TDD-CDMA but in 2009 we transitioning to 802.16e WiMax. I have spent considerable
 time understanding how to deploy the Wimax technology which differs significantly from typical GSM mobile base site engineering.
 My responsibilities have also included Implementation Management and Project Management of 
the rollout and integration of sites and provision of contingency backhaul utilising microwave technologies. </p><p>
Prior to this I was heavily involved both in TETRA as Chairman of the TETRA Business Solutions Group (TBSG) and secretary of
the TETRA Operators Association.  For the TBSG work I was presented with the "Outstanding
  contribution to TETRA in 2001" award at the TETRA MoU World Congress Gala Dinner.  
  This was reported in the <a href="twc.pdf">TETRA World Congress News</a> </p>
 <p>I have been involved with mobile communications, and software driven products since 1982 and understand its strengths
 and capabilities.  I have very strong commercial understanding of the mobile communications industry drivers and exhibit
  excellent interpersonal skills. During my career I have been involved in engineering, project management, operations management,
   manufacturing, network rollout and management consultancy, sales and marketing.</p>
