  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Hi, if you are you looking for an experienced professional in the field of mobile communications and related technologies,
   then maybe I can help you.</p>
<p>I have been involved in many projects at the leading edge of mobile communications since 1982 and 
  have operated as a freelance management consultant and held permanent roles. I have worked in all sectors 
  of business including Deployment, Operations Engineering, Sales and Marketing as well as 
  completing tasks in project and product management. I have occupied senior roles 
  in some of the well-known mobile communications companies such as
  Securicor Datatrak, Orange, Hutchison Mobile Data, Dolphin and more recently UK Broadband Ltd, a division
   of Hong Kong based PCCW.  I have also, whilst with Perot Systems, operated as a Management Consultant on a multi-million dollar
   business improvement project for Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.</p>
<p>My early mobile communications experience was gained setting up a communications 
  and maintenance facility for Dyfed Fire Service and this provided me with significant 
  insight into the mobile communications needs of the Fire Service. I am also 
  well versed in the workings of Utilities having spent considerable time, whilst 
  with Perot Systems, understanding the business processes and communications 
  requirements of Utilities both here and in the United States.  Since the early 
  ‘90’s mobile data has been tomorrow’s success story and like tomorrow the success 
  has never come. I have experienced the frustration and pain of mobile data and 
  understand the issues, maybe my experience could benefit you?</p>
  <p>During the late 90's and into 2000 I was heavily involved with the TETRA MoU as Chairman of the TETRA Business 
  Solutions group and as Secretary of the TETRA MoU Operators' Association.  You 
  can view details of both these organisations at <a href="http://www.tetramou.com/">http://www.tetramou.com/</a></p>
<p>The pinnacle of my achievements with the MoU was to receive the 'Outstanding contribution 
  to TETRA 2001' award at the 2001 TETRA World Congress in Nice.  This was reported in
   the <a href="twc.pdf">TETRA World Congress News.</a> </p> 
  <p> For many years I had a part time consultancy arrangement with Infocell Telecoms working on Real Time Passenger Information projects in Manchester, 
  Harrogate, Southampton, Riverside and Reading.</p>
  <p>Since 2004 I have been employed by UK Broadband Ltd(UKB) in various project management, implementation and engineering 
  roles implementing a TDD/CDMA network in West London and a Wimax network in Reading.  UK Broadband has also rolled out 
  WiFi And WiMax trial networks in Camden and other cities. I am currently responsible for base site engineering and have 
  been exploring the switch from TDD-CDMA to WiMax.  I have also been exploiting the minimal footprint of WiMax base
   sites and how to deploy them in a fast and furious fashion. We successfully transitioned our Reading TDD-CDMA network
  over to Wimax in May 2009.  We have also been experimenting with using Wimax and TDD as backhaul for WiFi networks and have current 
  trials in Reading</p>
  
  <h3>Availability</h3>
  <p> I am currently on a 9 month sabbatical travelling South East Asia with my wife, Carol, returning in March 2011
  at which time I will be avaiable for work. At that time I will be based in Windsor and for the foreseeable future.</p>
