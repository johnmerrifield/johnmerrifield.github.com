  <h3>The Story</h3>
  <h4> Day 1</h4>
  <p> The instructions said 'Follow the BMW roundels in the industrial estate which 
    will guide you to the depot' ...... my friend Paul and I said 
    'where are the BMW roundels'??  We eventually spied a likely looking building 
    by the amount of mud that was on the drive up to the main doors, typically 
    we were an hour and a half early and the place was deserted so we wondered 
    about catching some zzzzz's having been out of bed at 0430!!</p>
  <p> About an hour later the instructors arrived and having put on the Burco 
    for tea and coffee started expertly riding out a seemingly never ending stream 
    of 650GS, 650 Dakars and 1200GS's and parking up in the road outside. A steady 
    trickle of likely looking candidates arrived by car and bike some seeming 
    to brim with confidence others like ourselves somewhat apprehensive. The next 
    half hour was spent filling in forms, donning the hired boots and two piece 
    Savannah suits ready for the fray. Fortunately no-one had forgotten their 
    driving licence without which you cannot commence the course. 
  <p> 'Gentlemen select your bikes' was the next order of the day so the 30 or 
    so of us eventually zeroed in on a likely looking machine and familiarised 
    ourselves with the controls. Eventually we started riding in mass convoy up 
    to the Enduro Park a distance of about 8 miles, as the day was grey and fresh 
    I was soon severely doubting the wisdom of only wearing a tee shirt and knickers 
    under the Savannah suit as by the time we arrived I was absolutely freezing, 
    as it turned out feeling cold was to be the least of my worries!!!</p>
  <p> We were quickly divided into skill levels on the basis of: Done off road 
    before, regular road rider or occasional rider and with a few adjustments 
    to even up group size we were introduced to our instructor 'Gary'and moved 
    off in our groups to an open flat area of shale. First order of the day was 
    picking the bike up (it seemed we were going to be doing a lot of this!) followed 
    by holding the bike at its point of balance, full lock turns under power, 
    locked up rear wheel braking and front wheel braking by which time we were 
    all boiling hot and losing pounds due to the private saunas inside our suits.</p>
  <p> Following the free lunch of roast beef baguette, fruit and tea or coffee 
    we then nervously moved off on to some of the forest trails and this first 
    section was not without spills. We then commenced an exercise of riding down 
    a cliff using engine braking and then brakes..very scary....the photos just 
    dont do it justice!!! Oh and as a little sweetener Gary made us stop and restart 
    half way down the cliff...very amusing!!! It was somewhere around here that 
    Robert took a tumble which resulted in some serious ankle damage but being 
    the tough guy that he is he kept on riding</p>
  <p> We finished off the afternoon with more trail riding and putting our new 
    skills to use, then it was back to the depot get out of our gear and find 
    our accommodation. We were staying at the Abercrave Inn which we can highly 
    recommend, it has the particular advantage of hosting the group evening meal 
    which was attended by all the instructors and trainees, a very enjoyable evening 
    although some of us early starters could hardly keep our eyes open by the 
    end of the evening.</p>
  <h4>Day 2</h4>
  <p>What a contrast to the previous days grey skies, we were greeted by an absolutely 
    beautiful morning and after breakfast headed to the depot. Quite a few of 
    us were nursing bruises and aches and pains and Roberts ankle had swollen 
    so much he could not get his boot on so missed the second day entirely! The 
    rest of us convoyed back up to the Enduro park and were quickly back out on 
    the trails again.</p>
  <p>After a warm up run we were introduced to our second test of courage and 
    balance, this time on a different cliff we had to stop the bike in gear, get 
    off it, turn it around, get back on it and ride it down the hill!!! It has 
    to be said that those courageous types who went first demonstrated all the 
    ways NOT to dismount and control the bike to the benefit of the those who 
    had hung back at the start of the exercise, the standard definately improved 
    as we worked our way through the group
  <p> 
  <p> After a visit to the Chuck Wagon we were back in action, by now several 
    of us were limping and standing in the freezing cold stream to reduce the 
    pain in damaged feet and ankles. Next exercise was 'momentum' learning how 
    to declutch towards the top of a rise to be in control over the top. This 
    was great fun only marred by the fact that I crashed while turning around 
    to take my turn so now I had joined the ranks of the 'riding wounded'. 
  <p> The rest of the day was spent reinforcing the newly learned skills and I 
    particularly enjoyed a last 'burnup' around the trails with our new confidence 
    allowing us to do things we would not have thought possible just 24 hours 
    previous. Hats off to Gary, Simon and the rest of the the instructing team 
    for making hard work so enjoyable and finding a way to get through our fear. 
    Perhaps I will see you there next year when I am sure I will be back to either 
    redo Level 1 on a 1200 or maybe do Level 2??? I cant wait!!!...Oh and by the 
    way......buy or hire some decent boots and the schools riding gear..dont wreck 
    your own!!!</p>
