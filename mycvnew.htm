    <p>I have always been an engineer at heart, I have also loved getting involved in building relationships
    (one of my core skills!) and doing some of the 'fluffy' stuff like marketing and event coordination.
     I also really enjoy public speaking although I dont get much chance at present.</p>
     <p> I have been in the same role for over five years now and I think it is time for a change, so I am looking
      for something that exercises my 'people' skills more than at present. I guess I will know the role when it happens as I
      certainly do not have a 'spec' for it at the moment.</p> <p> If the right opportunity comes up then I will 
     definitely move, I guess my ideal would be a six month contract rather than a permanent 
     role.</p> <p> An overseas role may well hit the spot for me.</p>
